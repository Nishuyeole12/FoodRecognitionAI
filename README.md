# 🍕 Food Image Classifier using CNN

Welcome to the Food Image Classifier project!  
This deep learning model uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize and predict the **name of a food item** from an image.

> ✅ This project was developed as part of my 3rd-year B.Tech (AIDS) coursework at **Sanjivani College of Engineering**, with the goal of applying computer vision to real-world image classification tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 📷 **Input**: Food image  
- 🧠 **Model**: CNN trained on a custom food dataset  
- 🗂️ **Output**: Predicted **name** of the food (e.g., Pizza, Burger, Pasta)

This AI model helps in identifying food items from images using supervised learning and convolutional layers, and it has been trained and tested with a labeled dataset of popular food images.
